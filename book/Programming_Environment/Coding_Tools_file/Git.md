## Introduction

:::{dropdown} Do you know git history?
:color: info
:icon: info
**Linus** created open source system Linux in 1991. In 2005, **Linus** spent two weeks writing a distributed version control system in C language to manage the Linux system's source code. **Github** was founded in April 2008 by Chris Wanstrath, PJ Hyett, and Tom Preston-Werner to host versions based on **Git**. 

And now, **paying users** can build private repositories, **free users** can only use public repositories (or private repositories with up to 3 developers).

Git consists of three parts: `Working Directory`(工作区), `Index`(暂存区) and `Repository`(版本库):

- `Working Directory`: the directory that you can see on your computer
- `Index`: also called the `Stage`, it is usually stored in the `.git/index` file.
- `Repository`: the workspace has a hidden directory, the `.git`, which is the repository. It usually consists of a `branch` and `Head`, with the `Head` pointing to the result of your last submission.


**GitHub** is the single largest host for **Git** repositories, and we can host Git repositories on GitHub. The interaction between Git and Github is showing [figure](preview)
