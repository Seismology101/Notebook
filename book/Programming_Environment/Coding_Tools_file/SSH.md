# SSH


## Basic usage

The following commands are used to log in to the server over `SSH`

```bash
$ ssh user@hostname
```

By default, `SSH` connects to port `22` of the server


```bash
$ ssh -p 22 -X user@hostname
```

- `-p`: specifies the server port that the SSH client connects to
 
- `-X`: opens the X window for forwarding (eg. X11)




## Create SSH keys

::::{margin} About Passphrase:
:::{toggle}
One of the questions is about **_"Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase)"_**, and I chosse empty.
:::
::::

To create the keys, a preferred command is `ssh-keygen`. And `ssh-keygen` asks a series of questions and then writes **_a private key_** and **_a matching public key_**.

SSH keys are by default kept in the `~/.ssh` directory. If you do not have a `~/.ssh` directory, the `ssh-keygen` command creates it for you with the correct permissions. If an SSH key pair exists in the current location, those files are overwritten.




The following ssh-keygen command generates SSH RSA public and private key files by default in the `~/.ssh` directory.


```bash
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "fy21@rice.edu"
```

- `ssh-keygen`: the program used to create the keys

- `-t rsa`: type of key to create, in this case in the RSA format

- `-C "fy21@rice.edu"`: a comment appended to the end of the public key file to easily identify it. Normally an email address is used as the comment, but use whatever works best for your infrastructure.

The `~/.ssh` directory has some personal key files and other files.

```bash
$ ls -l ~/.ssh
total 32
-rw-r--r--@ 1 yinfu  staff  1479 Jul 26 16:23 config
-rw-------  1 yinfu  staff  2602 Jul 20 22:53 id_rsa
-rw-r--r--  1 yinfu  staff   567 Jul 20 22:53 id_rsa.pub
-rw-------  1 yinfu  staff   749 Jul 20 23:02 known_hosts
```

- `config`: the configuration file
- `id_rsa`: the private key
- `id_rsa.pub`: the public key
- `known_hosts`: the public key's fingerprint of existing SSH servers


## Upload SSH keys

The user public key is stored in the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the server. Each public key occupies a line. If the file does not exist, you can manually create it. 

The permission of the `authorized_keys` file must be set to `644`, that is, only the file owner can write.


:::::{tab-set}
::::{tab-item} Manually Uploading a Public Key
User can edit the `authorized_keys` file manually and paste the public key into it, or can run the following command on the local computer.

```bash
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@host "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
$ chmod 644 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
::::

::::{tab-item} ssh-copy-id
OpenSSH comes with the `ssh-copy-id` command to automatically copy the public key to the `~/. SSH /authorized_keys` file on the remote server. If the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file does not exist, the `ssh-copy-id` command automatically creates the file.
 

```bash
$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@host
```
:::{note}
`ssh-copy-id` adds the public key directly to the end of the `authorized_keys` file. If the end of the `authorized_keys` file is not a newline character, the new public key will be added to the end of the previous public key, and the two public keys will be linked together, making neither of them valid. Therefore, if the `authorized_keys` file already exists, make sure that the `authorized_keys` file ends with a newline character before using the `ssh-copy-id` command (assuming the file already exists).

## Configure SSH config file

Some main configuration commands of the SSH config file

- `Host`: the alias name.
- `HostName`: specifies the domain name or IP address.
- `User`: specify the account name for remote login.
- `IdentityFile`: specifies the private key file.
- `Port`: indicates the SSH server Port that the specified client connects to.


My `~/.ssh/config` configuration file
