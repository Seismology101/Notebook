Hi guys ðŸ‘‹, and welcome to **Seismology Notebook**. This notebook is mainly about my experience and gain in learning seismology, which can be regarded as my scientific notes, and I will be very glad if it can help you too. Enjoy!
 
The main content of the notebook as follows:

1. **Programming Environment**: configure the programming environment in MacOS.

2. **Programming Manual and Scripts**: some common and useful code scripts.

This is a small sample book to give you a feel for how book content is
structured.
It shows off a few of the major file types, as well as some sample content.
It does not go in-depth into any particular topic - check out [the Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org) for more information.
